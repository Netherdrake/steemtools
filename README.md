## Where are Account, Post, Blockchain and other utilities?
A big chunk of steemtools has been merged into [python-steem](https://github.com/xeroc/python-steem).

steemtools now serves as a library with some extras, that don't quite fit into the core steem library.


## Installation
```
pip install -U steemtools
```

## Examples
Please see [examples](https://github.com/Netherdrake/steemtools/tree/master/examples).
