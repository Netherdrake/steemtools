## Where are Account, Post and other utilities?
A big chunk of steemtools has been merged into [python-steem](https://github.com/xeroc/python-steem). ([documentation](http://pysteem.com/))

This library is a collection of things that don't quite fit into the main Python STEEM library.

## Installation
```
pip install -U steemtools
```

## Documentation
See the source.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

There are also a few [examples](https://github.com/Netherdrake/steemtools/tree/master/examples).
